# Vaccinate
整理台灣所有自費接種疫苗的資料
Collecting all the information about self-paid vaccines in Taiwan. 

## Set up project
Make sure you have [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed.
1. git clone the repository
2. run `pipenv install`.
3. run `yarn`
4. In one terminal, run `yarn backend`. This starts the Python Flask server. 
5. In another terminal, run `yarn frontend`. This starts Parcel, our JS bundler. 

## Translations
To make sure we're serving all of Taiwan it's imperative we translate to all the languages spoken here. I haven't settled on an i18n approach I'm happy with yet, but for now, to localize into a new language:
1. Translate the blurb in [Content.jsx](https://github.com/g0v/vaccinate/blob/master/frontend/Components/Content.jsx). This is the main content that shows on the site when arriving.
2. Translate the strings that live in the [Strings folder](https://github.com/g0v/vaccinate/tree/master/frontend/Strings).
3. Translate the content for the top [G0v banner](https://github.com/g0v/vaccinate/blob/master/frontend/Components/G0vbar.jsx).

To add support for a locale once all strings have been localized, override the `setLocale('en')` method call in [Content.jsx](https://github.com/g0v/vaccinate/blob/master/frontend/Components/Content.jsx) and set it to whatever language code you used to localize. 

Current priority languages:
* Tagalog
* Japanese
* Korean

## Code Quality

Some principles this project operates under:
* Dependencies should only be introduced where only necessary. The only project non-dev dependency in JS so far is React. This keeps the project easy-to-maintain.
* Configuration is minimal. We're using all the defaults for [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/), a zero-configuration JavaScript bundler. 

This project uses:
* [AirBnB JavaScript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* [Flow](https://flow.org/) for JavaScript typechecking
* [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python formatting
* [Pyre](https://pyrecheck.org) for Python type-checking with PEP484 Typehints.

## Architecture
This is an app in three parts:
1. A web app written in React. The code for this lives in `frontend/`.
2. A Local Scraper running on a machine in my living room. This is a python script that lives in `backend/local_scraper.py`. It is executed by-the-minute by a cronjob. It takes the results and uploads them to a Redis server. 
3. A Flask server written in Python. This server code lives in `backend/app.py`. This code runs on a DigitalOcean Droplet in Singapore. This droplet serves down the React app by reading the latest information from a Redis server and sending the data down. 

**Note:** Why separate the scraper from the droplet? Originally, I wanted to run everything on the droplet, but websites were blocking non-Taiwan IP addresses, so I was forced to find a scrape from Taiwan, which means a machine running on my family's network. 

When you are developing locally, instead of reading from the Redis server, it makes sense to scrape the data directly. Tthe `app.py` Flask server takes a `--scrape` flag, which when set will scrape locally instead of reading from the Redis server. 

## To write a scraper for a hospital
1. Open up data/hospitals.csv. Add your GitHub name as the owner next to that hospital. 
2. Note the ID for that hospital (e.g. 台大醫院 is 3.)
3. Write a scraper that makes a request to the webpage returns the ID and the `AppointmentAvailability` as a tuple (see examples)
4. Import your module in app.py and add your parser in the list of PARSERS. 
5. Run `yarn backend` and confirm that your code is correct
6. Make a Pull Request and tag @kevinjcliao to take a look. 

See [here](https://github.com/g0v/vaccinate/pull/1) for an example of a Pull Request. 

## Run Locally

You may use Docker to run web server and scraper locally in production mode.

```
docker compose up
```

## Known Issues
* After adding a new Python dependency, pipenv gets pretty unhappy. Run `pipenv lock --pre --clear` to fix. I've aliased this to `yarn fixpipenv`.

## Discuss
We're chatting in the #vaccine channel of the [g0v Slack](https://join.g0v.tw/). Come say hi! :)

## About g0v
g0v is Taiwan's polycentric civic tech community. We're a network of volunteers who build websites that serve the public good. Join us for our next Hackathon! You can find dates on the [Jothon Team](https://jothon.g0v.tw/) website. 

## Thanks
If you were able to book a vaccine using this website, I'd love it if you'd consider throwing a couple bucks towards mutual aid or solidarity organizations in your area. Some ideas:

* [Taiwan International Workers' Alliance](https://www.tiwa.org.tw/)
